### `data_collection.ipynb`

- All the logic for getting our dataset in the `dataset/` directory.

### `EDA_and_NLP_analysis.ipynb`

- This is where EDA and NLP (sentiment analysis) was done.

### `Adding_Bias.ipynb` (not important)

- Used for adding a small bias to manually rated articles in our test data (Only had to run once).

### `Harris_DeepLearning.ipynb` (not important)

- Used to get the pre-trained model for Harris (saved in google drive)

### `Trump_Deeplearning.ipynb` (not important)

- Used to get the pre-trained model for Trump (saved in google drive)

### `DL_Training_Kamala.ipynb`

- Deep Learning Model for Kamala.
- Needs the pre-trained model for Kamala.
- Coded in **Google Colab**

### `DL_Training_Trump.ipynb`

- Deep Learning Model for Trump.
- Needs the pre-trained model for Trump.
- Coded in **Google Colab**

## Important Notice

- The pre-trained models are extremly large, and used in Google Colab. To reproduce the results in both `DL_Training_Trump.ipynb` and `DL_Training_Kamala.ipynb`, you will need to access the following Google Drive Links

For the [Kamala Model](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GK0AOlX8rgyp1s0VxbcN4RMcSFD5hr-X)
